### What I've Built

**[JobOS](https://github.com/yonid4/JobOS)** — AI-powered LinkedIn job scraper that reads your resume, searches LinkedIn with your filters, and uses Google Gemini to score and surface only the best-matching jobs. Includes CAPTCHA handling, application tracking, cover letter generation, and Supabase auth.

**[When](https://github.com/yonid4/when)** — Smart event coordination app that finds the best meeting times across Google Calendar and Outlook. Uses Gemini AI to propose optimal slots based on participant availability, with real-time updates, timezone support, and calendar invites.

**[VALORANT Rank & Skin Viewer]([https://github.com/yonidayagi/valorant-rank-viewer](https://github.com/yonid4/VALORANT-rank-yoinker))** *(open source contribution)* — Python tool that retrieves players' competitive ranks and equipped skins during a live VALORANT match.

### Experience

🏗️ **AI Engineer — Startup (B2B, Construction Tech)**
Built an AI-powered RFP analysis tool that cut document review time from 2–3 days to under 8 minutes. Advocated for switching from OpenAI to Google Gemini, which improved accuracy from ~80% to 95%+ and sped up analysis by over 50%. Implemented a RAG pipeline with ChromaDB and semantic search.
